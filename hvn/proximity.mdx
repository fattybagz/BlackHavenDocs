<Info>
MegaETH's Proximity Market allows market makers and dApps to bid for sequencer-adjacent floorspace, improving execution speed and liquidity efficiency across DeFi.
</Info>

Blackhaven will actively participate in the MegaETH sequencer and proximity markets using MEGA accumulated through treasury operations. HVN governance controls how this MEGA is deployed to strengthen Blackhaven's position within the ecosystem and align with yield opportunities and network utility.

## Blackhaven Bribe Market

External parties could bribe Blackhaven into directing existing staked MEGA toward their floorspace. This lets external parties access the proximity market without taking on the price risk and liquidity constraints of buying and staking MEGA directly.

For HVN holders, bribes flow into the treasury to further increase reserve backing, creating another revenue stream on top of treasury performance. 

<Tip>
The more MEGA Blackhaven accumulates, the more valuable HVN voting power becomes to external parties competing for proximity market allocation.
