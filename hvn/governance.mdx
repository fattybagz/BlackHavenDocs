HVN is the governance token of Blackhaven. It gives holders direct influence over key parameters and strategic direction. Governance is fully on-chain and open to all HVN holders.

Contributors and core participants initiate proposals, while HVN holders vote to approve or reject them. This keeps decision-making efficient and informed while still reflecting the community's will.

## Governance Scope

Proposals may include adjustments to:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Treasury Management** | Treasury composition, deployment strategy, and reserve parameters |
| **Reward Distribution** | Reward distribution rates and emission schedules |
| **Strategy Approval** | Approval or removal of MegaETH DeFi strategies |
| **MEGA Allocation** | Allocation of Blackhaven's staked MEGA within the Proximity Market |

## Voting Power

Each HVN token represents **one vote**. This keeps the process transparent, data-driven, and aligned with long-term ecosystem growth.
