External parties could bribe Blackhaven into directing existing staked MEGA toward their floorspace. This lets external parties access the proximity market without taking on the price risk and liquidity constraints of buying and staking MEGA directly.

For HVN holders, bribes flow into the treasury to further increase reserve backing, creating another revenue stream on top of treasury performance. The more MEGA Blackhaven accumulates, the more valuable HVN voting power becomes to external parties competing for proximity market allocation.
