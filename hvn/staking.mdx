sHVN represents staked HVN and serves as the governance-linked token that anchors participation and reward distribution across Blackhaven.

## How sHVN Works

sHVN holders earn rewards from treasury growth and other incentives accumulated through treasury management. Rewards will be distributed to stakers based on the available reward pool, which will be configured after the treasury growth phase through a governance proposal.

<Tip>
The system rewards participants who demonstrate **long-term alignment** with Blackhaven's growth, not short-term speculation.
