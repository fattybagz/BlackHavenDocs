Blackhaven's fee structure is designed to create a sustainable, self-reinforcing flywheel that rewards both RBT and HVN holders for their distinct contributions to the ecosystem.

## Revenue Sources

The Blackhaven treasury generates revenue from six primary sources:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Yield from DeFi Strategies** | Returns generated from deploying HPN deposits into whitelisted MegaETH protocols |
| **Early Exit Fees** | Penalties collected from users who exit HPNs or bonds before maturity |
| **BAM Fees** | Fees generated from arbitraging RBT when it trades above its backing |
| **Sequencer Staking Rewards** | Yield earned from staking the treasury's MEGA holdings |
| **RBT Pool Trading Fees** | Fees generated from the RBT-USDM liquidity pool |
| **HVN Pool Trading Fees** | Fees generated from the HVN-USDM liquidity pool |

## Fee Split and Bootstrap Period

To ensure the treasury has sufficient resources to build a strong foundation, there will be a **bootstrap period** following the launch of the HVN token.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Bootstrap Period">
    100% of all net treasury revenue is directed to the protocol treasury to build Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) and fund operations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revenue Sharing Activation">
    After the bootstrap period, revenue sharing will be activated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ongoing Distribution">
    Fees from net treasury revenue will be allocated to sHVN holders in the form of buybacks, while a portion will continue to flow to the protocol treasury.
  </Step>
