Blackhaven DEX is a fully on-chain decentralized exchange built on MegaETH. It introduces the first bonding mechanism built directly into a DEX. Protocols capture Protocol Owned Liquidity instead of incentivizing rented capital, while users purchase tokens with near zero slippage.

Powered by MegaETH's real-time blockchain infrastructure, Blackhaven DEX delivers **sub-millisecond execution** and high throughput, enabling trading conditions that rival centralized exchanges while maintaining full self-custody and composability.

<Tip>
Blackhaven captures all volume and fees that would otherwise flow to external protocols by controlling both the liquidity layer and trading infrastructure. Deeper liquidity attracts more trading, more fees, and more value for the protocol.
