Haven Protected Notes (HPNs) are principal-protected deposit instruments issued as ERC-721 NFTs. Users deposit stable assets into Blackhaven, which deploys that capital into vetted MegaETH strategies while guaranteeing the original deposit remains fully redeemable. Unlike token-based positions, HPNs are not market-priced instruments. Their value is defined solely by the principal, accrued rewards, and commitment terms.

**Quick Steps:**

1. Select a commitment term
2. Deposit USDM
3. Receive an NFT representing your position
4. Position accrues yield over the term
5. At maturity, claim principal plus yield

<Tip>
Deposits earn ecosystem rewards, claimable when released by MegaETH.

## User Options

- **Hold to Maturity:** Hold the HPN through its term. The position accrues yield. At maturity, redeem full principal plus accrued yield. Ecosystem rewards earned are claimable when released.

- **Early Redemption:** Exit at any time and recover full principal. Accrued yield and ecosystem rewards are forfeited to the treasury.

- **RBT Redemption:** Redeem the HPN for RBT equal to the initial principal. The HPN burns on redemption and accrued yield and ecosystem rewards are forfeited to the treasury.

<Tip>
At maturity or early exit, the HPN enters a 7-day cooldown, after which the position becomes claimable.
