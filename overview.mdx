Blackhaven is a reserve-backed treasury that functions as a liquidity engine for the MegaETH ecosystem. It grows by putting deposited capital to work in vetted DeFi strategies, then shares the returns with participants while building up its reserves.

Users deposit assets and receive principal-protected notes or fixed-term bonds. These instruments earn yield as the treasury deploys capital into approved MegaETH protocols. Returns flow back to participants, and any surplus gets reinvested to grow the reserve.

The treasury also expands by capturing its own trading premium. When the treasury token trades above its backing value, the protocol mints new tokens and sells them at that premium. This adds more assets to the reserve without diluting existing holders, since each new token is backed by more than it should be.

## Core Objectives

Blackhaven is designed to achieve five core objectives that define its function within the MegaETH ecosystem:

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Protect Principal** | Note depositors' capital stays fully backed and redeemable, with verifiable on-chain reserves. |
| **Capture On-Chain Value** | Earn rewards from approved MegaETH DeFi strategies that balance capital efficiency with risk-adjusted performance. |
| **Accumulate Reserve Value** | Grow treasury assets through bonds, fees, forfeits, and ecosystem rewards. |
| **Anchor Liquidity** | Support and stabilize key MegaETH protocols by directing reserves into ecosystem pools. |
| **DAT Layer for MegaETH** | Build a foundational, sustainable treasury backbone that powers MegaETH's long-term infrastructure. |
