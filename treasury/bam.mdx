The Backing Arbitrage Module (BAM) is a two-way arbitrage mechanism that captures value when RBT deviates from its Net Asset Value (NAV), converting market volatility into permanent treasury growth.

<Tip>
When RBT trades above NAV, existing RBT is sold into the premium and proceeds go directly to the treasury. It's arbitrage for the benefit of every RBT holder.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor">
    Contract monitors RBT market price against NAV
  </Step>
  <Step title="Premium Capture">
    If above NAV: Sell RBT for USDM, add USDM to backing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discount Capture">
    If below NAV: Buy RBT with USDM, burn the RBT
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scale">
    Capture rate scales with deviation from NAV
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cooldown">
    Cooldown between operations prevents gaming and smooths market impact
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Premium Capture (RBT > NAV)

When RBT trades **above NAV**, the protocol sells existing RBT into the premium. USDM proceeds go directly to treasury backing.

## Discount Capture (RBT < NAV)

When RBT trades **below NAV**, the protocol uses treasury USDM to buy RBT from the market and burn it. This reduces circulating supply and pushes price back toward NAV.

<Info>
Over time, every premium gets partially captured. Every capture adds backing. **The floor rises with each cycle.**
