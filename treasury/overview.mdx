The Treasury holds all reserve assets owned by Blackhaven. Its primary role is to back RBT, deploy liquidity across MegaETH DeFi, and grow reserves sustainably. Treasury operations prioritize conservative risk parameters with full on-chain transparency.

## Key Sources of Treasury Inflow

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **User Deposits** | Reserve assets from Fixed-Term Bonds and HPN redemptions against RBT |
| **Yield** | Generated from treasury strategy allocations |
| **Points Programs** | Mega Points from qualifying activities |
| **User Forfeitures** | Early exit fees, forfeited yield, and forfeited Mega Points |
| **BAM** | Captures value when RBT trades above or below backing |

## Amplifying RBT Backing

Treasury inflows increase backing per RBT. Forfeited rewards, yields, fees, and BAM premium captures add to reserves while circulating supply stays constant. BAM discount captures reduce supply through burns.

<Tip>
Both mechanisms create upward pressure on RBT's intrinsic value over time, maintaining a transparent link between treasury value and circulating RBT supply.

## DAT-Inspired Retention of MEGA

Blackhaven introduces a DAT-inspired allocation model by retaining MEGA tokens derived from Mega Points. The treasury earns points through its Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) positions, forfeits, early exit penalties, and capital allocations.

This captured MEGA fuels treasury reserves and could potentially increase the backing of RBT. To foster deeper alignment with MegaETH, **all MEGA will be staked in the MegaETH Sequencer**, cycling rewards directly back into reserves.

<Note>
**Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL):** Inspired by OlympusDAO's pioneering model, POL ensures liquidity without relying on liquidity mining incentives. Blackhaven adopts this model through LP bonds, building treasury-owned liquidity that provides deep, permanent market depth for RBT.
