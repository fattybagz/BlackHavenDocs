RBT Notes are fixed-term lockup instruments issued as ERC-721 NFTs that let holders earn guaranteed yield by committing their RBT for a set period. Unlike liquid staking where rewards vary and capital can leave at any time, Notes offer a simple proposition: lock now, know your exact return, collect at maturity.

## How Notes Work

1. Choose your term
2. Deposit RBT into the contract
3. Receive an NFT representing your position
4. Your yield is calculated and locked in from day one
5. At maturity, burn the NFT and claim principal plus yield

## Early Exit

You can redeem before maturity, but it comes with two costs:

1. **Forfeited yield:** You receive zero yield regardless of how long you held
2. **Principal penalty:** Up to 10% of your deposit, scaling linearly with time remaining

The penalty decreases proportionally with time held. Exit at the start of your term and pay the full 10%. Exit halfway through and pay 5%. Exit near maturity and pay close to nothing.

<Tip>
Penalties flow back into the contract, funding future yields for holders who complete their terms.

## Yield Curve

Yield scales with term length, combining a base yield with a bonus that accelerates for longer commitments:

$$
\text{Yield}(t) = r_{\text{base}} \times \frac{t}{t_{\max}} + r_{\text{bonus}} \times \left(\frac{t}{t_{\max}}\right)^{2}
$$

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| t | Term length in weeks |
| t_max | 52 weeks |
| r_base | 19% |
| r_bonus | 33% |

<Note>
**Rewards Pool:** RBT Notes yield is funded by a capped rewards pool. When the pool is fully allocated, new Note deposits close until the pool refills. Deposits reopen as rewards flow back into the pool. First come, first serve.
</Note>

**Rewards inflows:**

- Excess mints from bonds
- Forfeited yield (early exit from RBT Notes)
- Principal penalty (early exit from RBT Notes)
- Forfeited unvested RBT (early redemption from bonds)

## Enhanced Bond Discounts

Active RBT Notes unlock scaled bond discounts based on term length and amount locked. The discount bonus applies automatically when purchasing bonds, with longer commitments and larger positions earning greater advantages.

**Formula:**

<div className="formula-box">

**Eligibility:**
- Note Term > 12 weeks
- RBT Amount ≥ Minimum Threshold

**Thresholds** (governance-adjustable):
- Min Threshold = 1,000 RBT
- Max Threshold = 10,000 RBT
- Maximum Bonus Discount = 2.5%

**Bonus Calculation:**
- Term Factor = (Note Term − 12) / (52 − 12)
- Amount Factor = min((RBT Amount − Min Threshold) / (Max Threshold − Min Threshold), 1)
- Combined Factor = (Term Factor + Amount Factor) / 2
- Bonus Discount = Combined Factor × Maximum Bonus Discount

**Final Bond Discount** = Base Discount (from debt ratio) + Bonus Discount

</div>

<Info>
Governance may adjust threshold parameters to maintain appropriate requirements as market conditions evolve.

$$
D_{\text{final}} = D_{\text{base}} + \left[\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{t - 12}{52 - 12} + \min\left(\frac{A - T_{\min}}{T_{\max} - T_{\min}}, 1\right)\right) \times B_{\max}\right]
$$

**where:**

- *D_final* = final bond discount
- *D_base* = base discount from debt ratio
- *t* = Note term in weeks
- *A* = RBT amount locked in Note
- *T_min* = minimum RBT threshold (1,000 RBT)
- *T_max* = maximum RBT threshold (10,000 RBT)
- *B_max* = maximum bonus discount (2.5%)
