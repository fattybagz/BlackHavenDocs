RBT is backed by assets held in the Blackhaven treasury. As the treasury grows through bond issuance, forfeits, and yield, backing per RBT increases. Market price may trade above or below this backing value.

Use RBT across the MegaETH DeFi ecosystem in various products and liquidity strategies, allowing users to engage with on-chain markets while maintaining alignment with Blackhaven's treasury growth.
